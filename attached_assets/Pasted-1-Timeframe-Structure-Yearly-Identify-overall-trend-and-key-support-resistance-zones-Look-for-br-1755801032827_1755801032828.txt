1. Timeframe Structure

Yearly: Identify overall trend and key support/resistance zones. Look for breakout potentials.

Monthly: Confirm the yearly trend, check for major retracements or consolidations.

Weekly: Confirm monthly trend, refine support/resistance levels.

Daily: Identify entries based on weekly trends and local daily patterns.

4H/1H: Fine-tune exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit.

2. Trend Analysis

Draw trendlines on yearly, monthly, and weekly charts.

Confirm trend alignment:

Uptrend: Price higher highs and higher lows across Y/M/W/D charts.

Downtrend: Price lower highs and lower lows across Y/M/W/D charts.

Only take trades in the direction of the major trend.

3. Support & Resistance

Identify S/R levels across all timeframes.

Entry is considered only if:

Price is near support in an uptrend (buy setup).

Price is near resistance in a downtrend (sell setup).

Check for convergence across weekly and daily levels for higher reliability.

4. Fibonacci Analysis

Draw Fibonacci retracements from swing low to swing high (or vice versa for downtrend).

Entry levels:

Buy: Near 38.2%–61.8% retracement in uptrend.

Sell: Near 38.2%–61.8% retracement in downtrend.

Predict potential backlashes or targets with Fibonacci extensions (127%, 161.8%).

5. Entry & Confirmation

Entry is only valid if multiple factors align:

Trend direction (Y/M/W/D)

Price at strong support/resistance

Fibonacci level in alignment

Candlestick pattern confirming reversal/continuation (e.g., pin bar, engulfing)

If not all conditions met → No trade, wait.

6. Stop-Loss & Trailing

Place stop-loss below/above last swing low/high.

Use trailing stop when trade moves in favor to secure profits:

Move stop to break-even after 50% of expected move.

Trail stops along Fibonacci levels or moving averages.

7. Prediction Guidance

Use trendlines + S/R + Fibonacci to anticipate breakout or retracement.

Price moving up weekly/daily near strong support → higher chance of breakout.

If no clear alignment or signals → advise hold or wait.

8. Repainting Prevention

Only consider confirmed candle closes for entry.

Avoid real-time repainting indicators.

Mark signals only after confirmation on lower timeframe (1H/4H) relative to higher timeframe trend.
