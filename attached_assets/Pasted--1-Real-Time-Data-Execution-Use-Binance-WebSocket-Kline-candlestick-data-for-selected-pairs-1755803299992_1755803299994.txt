📡 1. Real-Time Data & Execution:

Use Binance WebSocket Kline (candlestick) data for selected pairs at 1m interval.

Parse and store open, high, low, close for each candle in real-time.

Plot real-time charts for:

Price movements (per asset)

Balance over time

Trade markers (BUY/SELL)

💹 2. Pairs Traded:
PAIRS = ['EURUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BTCUSDT', 'ADAUSDT', 'SOLUSDT']


Each pair has its own strategy, thread, and trade log.

📈 3. Strategy Logic (One per Pair):

BTCUSDT → Trend-following:

Buy if price > EMA(14)

Sell if price < EMA(14)

ETHUSDT → RSI reversal:

Buy if RSI < 30

Sell if RSI > 70

EURUSDT → RSI+EMA momentum:

Buy if price > EMA(14) and RSI > 50

Sell if price < EMA(14) and RSI < 50

ADAUSDT → Price confirmation:

Buy if current_close > previous_close and price > EMA(14)

Sell if current_close < previous_close and price < EMA(14)

SOLUSDT → Breakout:

Buy if price breaks above the highest high of the last 10 candles

Sell if price breaks below the lowest low of the last 10 candles

🔒 4. Risk Management:

Risk per trade: 1% of current virtual balance

Reward-to-Risk Ratio (RRR): 1.5

Stop-Loss: 1% below/above entry price

Take-Profit: 1.5% above/below entry price

Trailing Stop (optional for future update)

📊 5. Trade Execution Logic (Virtual):

No real orders placed — only virtual tracking.

Once a strategy triggers a trade (BUY or SELL):

Log entry price, pair, direction, TP, SL

Monitor subsequent candles in real-time (thread)

If price hits TP → count as Win

If price hits SL → count as Loss

Update balance, PnL, win/loss counter

📈 6. GUI/Plot Features:

Live-updating Matplotlib plots

Balance history (with PnL markers)

Price chart per pair

Update every few seconds

Annotate BUY/SELL actions on charts

🔁 7. Other:

All trades and plots must run in independent threads to ensure live responsiveness.

Protect against duplicate trades per pair — only one open trade per pair at a time.
